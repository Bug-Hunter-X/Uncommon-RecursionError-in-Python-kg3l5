This repository demonstrates a subtle RecursionError in Python.  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` recursively calls itself.  While it works for small values of `n`, exceeding Python's recursion limit will trigger a `RecursionError`. The solution involves converting the recursion into an iterative approach.  This example illustrates the importance of understanding and avoiding stack overflow issues in recursive functions.
